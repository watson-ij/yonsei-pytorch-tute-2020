* Pytorch Hands-on

** Goals

- If you're already a deep learning master, not the talk for you!
- Get up and running quickly with Deep Learning
  - In particular, the goal is to build neural networks you can take home today!
- Therefore, use /PyTorch/ to get up and running quickly
- Outline of the session:
  - Basic Usage of PyTorch (Iris)
  - Convolutional Neural Net in PyTorch (MNIST)
  - GANs (using MNIST)
- For this lecture, I recommend using /google colaboratory/
  - Machine learning education and research tool setup by google, all
    the packages are installed, just need a google account to sign in

https://colab.research.google.com


** Dependencies

/However,/

If you want to follow along with a local setup:

With python and pip installed, you can pull the dependencies by pip
installing (you might need to add `--user` to the end of the command
lines):

#+LATEX: \footnotesize
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Optional, setup a separate virtualenv to keep everything clean
virtualenv ENV
source ENV/bin/activate
# Download dependencies
pip install matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn h5py jupyter
# Download the CPU version of pytorch
pip install torch==1.6.0+cpu torchvision==0.7.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
# Then you could start a notebook
jupyter notebook
#+END_SRC

For a GPU-capable version of pytorch (CUDA, which means you need an
nVidia card), check

** Overarching Idea of (Supervised) Maching Learning

- Framework for Machine Learning: given a set of data, and set of
  expected outputs (typically categories), build a system which learns
  how to connect data to output
- Neural Network is one type, connect stacks of tensor operators with fixed linear and non-linear transformations
- Optimize transformation parameters so as to approximate expected outputs

** The iris dataset and a basic network with Keras

- Let's take a concrete example
- The iris dataset is a classic classification task, first studied by
  Fisher in 1936. 
- The goal is, given features measured from a particular
  iris, classify it into one of three species
  - Iris setosa, virginica, versicolor. 
- The variables are: Sepal width and length, petal width and length (all in cm).

** Iris dataset

We begin by loading the iris dataset, helpfully available from the
seaborn pacakge, which also lets us create plots showing the
correlations between the variables.

#+LATEX: \footnotesize
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python :display plain
iris = sns.load_dataset("iris")
iris.head()
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

: 0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  setosa
: 1           4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  setosa
: 2           4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  setosa
: 3           4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  setosa
: 4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  setosa

** Iris Variables

#+LATEX: \footnotesize
Lets view the basic variables we have. Setosa (blue) looks easily
separable by the petal length and width, but versicolor and virginica
are a little tricky.

** The Logistic Function and Logistic Regression

\centering
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .4\textwidth
[[file:figures/logistic.pdf]]

- The logistic (or sigmoid) function is defined as \(f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}\)
  - Looks like a classic "turn-on" curve
- Concentrate on the case of two classes (cat/dog or electron/photon),
  and ask what we want from a classifier output
  - We need to distinguish between the two classes using the output:
  - If the value is 0, it represents the classifier identifying one class (cat)
  - If its near 1, the classifier is identifies the other class (dog)
  - Thus, we need to transform the input variables into 1D, then pass through the logistic function
- This is a simple classification technique called /logistic regression/

** Neural Networks Overview

#+LATEX: \centering
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .5\textwidth
[[file:figures/neural_net.jpeg]]

- Example shown: input vector $\vec{x}$, goes through
  $\vec{y}_{hidden} = W\vec{x} + \vec{b}$, then $\vec{y}_{output} =
  \sigma(\vec{y}_{hidden})$ (\sigma is some non-linear turn-on curve)
- I.e. hidden layer combines $\vec{x}$ by some weights, then if the
  weighted sum passes a threshold $\vec{b}$, we turn on the output
  (with the $\sigma(x) = 1/(1+e^{-x})$ to gate the ops)
- Need to *train* the weight matrix $W$ and the bias vector $b$ and
  optimize a "loss" function that represents a distance from the target output

** Backpropagation

- The algorithm to train neural networks is called *backpropagation*
- Its essentially a gradient descent implemented taking the network
  structure into account to speed up evaluation of the partials
- To apply gradient descent, need a function of a single variable, called the /loss/
  - \(L(x_i|\sigma) = \sum_i |f(x_i | \sigma) - y_i|^2\) for inputs \(x_i\) and known output \(y_i\)
- We start with the parameters set to arbitrary values, usually picked from e.g. unit gaussian
- We run a forward pass through the network and calculate the loss
- Using the chain rule, calculate /all/ the derivates backward from the loss to
  the higher layers
- Propagate changes based on the gradient $\Delta w_i = -\eta \frac{\partial f}{\partial w_i}$
- For more on how backpropagation works: _[[http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html]]_

** PyTorch Networks

In order to classify the irises, we'll build a simple network in PyTorch.

- Helper functions to easily build neural networks are provided by the
  =torch.nn= module (usually imported as =nn=)
- In PyTorch, neural networks are made as classes deriving from
  =nn.Module=
- You need to provide an =__init__= method setting up the parameters
  (i.e. attach them to =self=), and a =forward(x)= method which
  returns the network output for the input =x=
  - PyTorch keeps track of the parameters and the *computational
    graph* which is needed to efficiently perform backpropagation
- Interface to/from the model with the PyTorch =Tensor= class
  (essentially a numpy array which can be interfaced with PyTorch's
  backprop and can be placed on the GPU)
  - In fact, =Tensor.numpy()= will give you back a regular numpy array

#+LATEX: \centering
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .5\textwidth
[[file:figures/nn-1a.png]]


#+begin_src jupyter-python
arr = np.array([1.,2.,3.])
print(th.Tensor(arr)) # build from a numpy array
print(th.Tensor([1.,2.,3.])) # or a python array
print(th.linspace(1., 3., 3)) # or a helper function
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([1., 2., 3.])
: tensor([1., 2., 3.])
: tensor([1., 2., 3.])

** Model

- Our model will be a simple NN with a single hidden layer
- We start by building a Sequential model and add a Dense (fully-connected) layer, with sigmoid activation
- Dense: standard layer, all inputs connect to all outputs: $\hat{y} = W\hat{x} + \hat{b}$
  - =keras.layers.Dense(output_dim)=
  - Can also set the initalization, add an activation layer inline, add regularizers inline, etc.
- Activation: essentially acts as a switch for a given node, turns output on/off based on threshold
  - =keras.layers.Activation(= /type/ =)=
    - Where /type/ might be:
  - /sigmoid/: $f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
  - /tanh/: $f(x) = \tanh{x} = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$
  - /relu/: $f(x) = \mathrm{max}(0, x)$, 'rectified linear unit'
  - /softplus/: $f(x) =  \ln{(1 + e^x)}$, smooth approx. to /relu/
  - /softmax/: $f_k(x) = \frac{e^{-x_k}}{\sum_i e^{-x_i}}$ for the $k$'th output, as last layer of categorical distribution, represents a probability distribution over the outputs

** Build a model: Python code

#+LATEX: \footnotesize \vspace{-2mm}
#+BEGIN_SRC jupyter-python

class MyNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        # setup with nn.Module's initializer
        super(MyNet, self).__init__()
        # Linear is a helper creating a fully-connected layer
        # (i.e. typical feedforward neural network)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4,128) # fc=fully-connected
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128,3) # 3 possible outputs
    def forward(self, x):
        # Typical pattern in torch code, reuse the name x for
        # successive layers
        x = th.sigmoid(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Build a model
net = MyNet()
net
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: MyNet(
:   (fc1): Linear(in_features=4, out_features=128, bias=True)
:   (fc2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=3, bias=True)
: )

- Simply use the regular torch functions available in 
- Notice, we didn't specify a softmax activation in the final layer
  - We'll see why when we get to training
- To use, simply pass in an input tensor

#+begin_src jupyter-python
input = th.tensor([1.,2.,3.,4.])
net(input)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([-0.0109, -0.5471, -0.4335], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)

- Note that the network allows you to pass in several datapoints at
  once, so you can use a tensor of dimension 1 more than the
  dimension of a single datapoint
- Here, we have a 1d tensor with 4 elements in the first dimension, so
  we can pass a dimension 2 tensor in (the first dimension is the n-inputs dimension)

#+begin_src jupyter-python
# Process two inputs, get back two outputs
input = th.tensor([[1.,2.,3.,4.],
                   [2.,3.,4.,5.]])
net(input)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([[-0.0109, -0.5471, -0.4335],
:         [ 0.0038, -0.5836, -0.4449]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)

- To run on the GPU, we need to make sure all the parameters of the
  network are placed on the GPU, and the inputs are placed on the GPU.
  - We can use the =Tensor.cuda()= funcion which returns a GPU copy of the tensor
  - We can also use =Tensor.to(dev)= with =dev =
    th.device('cuda:0')= to specify a specific CUDA device, or have a
    way to switch to cpu (=dev = th.device('cpu')=, could have an
    if-clause choosing cuda if available or else CPU)
- Similarly, we can put a cuda tensor back on the CPU with =Tensor.cpu()=

#+begin_src jupyter-python
net = net.cuda() # put network on GPU 
input = input.cuda() # and the input tensor
net(input) # you should see the device is now displayed
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([[-0.0109, -0.5471, -0.4335],
:         [ 0.0038, -0.5836, -0.4449]], device='cuda:0', grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)

** Loss function

- To train a network, we need a function to minimize, a /loss/ function
- There are many loss functions built-in to pytorch, some useful ones:
  - =BCELoss= : binary cross-entropy loss, for classifying a single
    output for on-off/yes-no conditions, it returns -log(output) if
    the result should be 1, -log(1-output) if the result should be 0
    - This derives from a likelihood anaylsis of the binomial distribution
  - =CrossEntropyLoss= : cross-entropy loss, for classifying into
    multiple categories using a one-hot encoding scheme, \\
    -log(softmax_output[correct position])
  - =MSELoss= : mean-square error loss, useful for regression and
    similar
- They have the common form =loss_fn(prediction, true_values)=
  - =prediction= is the network output for a batch, =true_values= are
    the corresponding truth labels

Lets start with an example of binary cross-entropy loss. Use when
there's only 2 classes to classify. Here, we also show a quicker way
of setting up a simple network using =Sequential= (should be familiar
if you know Keras).

#+begin_src jupyter-python
# For simple networks just containing stacks of layers, one can use
# the Sequential module instead, need explicit layers for the
# activation in this case
aNet = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(2,4), nn.Sigmoid(), nn.Linear(4,1), nn.Sigmoid()).cuda()

loss_fn = th.nn.BCELoss() # the losses live in torch.nn
out = aNet(th.zeros(2).cuda()) # the net is on the GPU
loss = loss_fn(out, th.tensor([1.]).cuda()) # one datapt
print(loss.item(), -th.log(out).item()) # theres no magic
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 1.0108411312103271 1.0108411312103271

For more than two outputs, we use cross-entropy loss. In pytorch, the
loss function applies the softmax itself (so we don't need it in our
network), and then applies the -log(p) function on the true values
output [think of it like the -log of the networks probability for it
to be the true value].

#+begin_src jupyter-python
loss_fn = th.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
# the net is on the GPU, here we create 3 inputs, each filled with zeros
out = net(th.zeros(3,4).cuda())
 # for CrossEntropyLoss, the true values should be the position of the real label
print(loss_fn(out, th.tensor([0,1,2]).cuda()))
# Note that the output is the *average* of the losses of all the input items
#   this makes it easier to process a batch of inputs and run gradient descent
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor(1.1006, device='cuda:0', grad_fn=<NllLossBackward>)

Just to be explicit of what CrossEntropyLoss means.
- /softmax/ normalizes the output layer so it sums to 1: $f_k(x) = \frac{e^{-y_k}}{\sum_i e^{-y_i}}$
- Cross-entropy loss is the -log(p) where p is the output of the softmax for the (known) true value
  - We are in the fully-labelled paradigm for training

#+begin_src jupyter-python
out = net(th.zeros(1,4).cuda())
# use item() to extract a single value from a tensor and return as a python float
print("output of the loss_fn", loss_fn(out, th.tensor([0]).cuda()).item())
# we softmax over the outputs (zeroth axis is the datapoints axis, first axis is the output axis)
print(th.softmax(out,1))
# The softmax output sums to 1, hence its like a "probability for each possible output"
print(th.softmax(out,1).sum().item())
# then cross entropy is the -log(p) where p is the true output, here
# we pretend that we know the 0th category is the true category
print(-th.log(th.softmax(out,1)[0,0]).item())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: output of the loss_fn 1.0241286754608154
: tensor([[0.3591, 0.3335, 0.3074]], device='cuda:0', grad_fn=<SoftmaxBackward>)
: 1.0
: 1.0241286754608154

The closer the output of the true value is to 1, the closer the
CrossEntropyLoss is to 0. The closer it is to 0, the CrossEntropyLoss
will exponentially approach -infinity. Hence, minimizing the
CrossEntropyLoss is equivalent to maximizing the softmax output
probability of the true value to 1, and true value softmax outputs
close to 0 are exponentially penalized (its worse to be close to 0
than it is to be a little bit further from 1).

If you want to apply the softmax inside the network yourself, you can
use =NLLLoss= instead of =CrossEntropyLoss=. The reason you wouldn't
is that to get a "prediction" from an unknown datapoint after training
the network, you can just take the position with the max of the
network output, you don't need to calculate the (relatively expensive)
softmax, which is just rescaling the values so they're all between 0
and 1.

=BCELoss= expects a value between 0 and 1, so you should apply
=sigmoid= to the final layer in this case.


** Training

- Now we fit to the training data. 
- We can set the number of =epochs=, =batch_size=, and =verbose='ity
  - Epochs: number of training passes through the complete dataset
  - Batch size: number of datapoints to consider together when
    updating the network
- We pass through the input data as a numpy array (nsamples, 4)
- We pass the output as (nsamples, 3) where for each sample one
  of the positions is 1, corresponding to the correct class. 
- We transform the raw species information (which labels classes as
  strings: "setosa", "virginica", "versicolor") to the expected format
  - Setosa = should give =(1, 0, 0)=, i.e. 1 in the 0th position
  - Versicolor = =(0, 1, 0)=
  - Virginica = =(0, 0, 1)=

#+begin_src jupyter-python
variables = iris.values[:, :4]
species = iris.values[:, 4]

# One hot encode the species target
smap = {'setosa' : 0, 'versicolor' : 1, 'virginica' : 2}
species_enc = np.array(list(smap[s] for s in species))

# To show we are simply passing numpy arrays of the data
print(iris.iloc[0])
print("----------")
print(variables[0], ":", species[0], ":", species_enc[0])
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: sepal_length       5.1
: sepal_width        3.5
: petal_length       1.4
: petal_width        0.2
: species         setosa
: Name: 0, dtype: object
: ----------
: [5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2] : setosa : 0

** Training Loop

- By default, there's no automatic training functions in PyTorch, you're expected to build it yourself
  - This is different from, say, Keras, which gives you a 'fit' function
- It does give you the tools to build the loop easily though
- We will fit the model to a labelled dataset by creating a "training
  loop"
- We will pass a minibatch into the network, calculate the average
  loss, the update the network based on minimizing that minibatch loss
  - This is "Stochastic Gradient Descent", as opposed to full gradient
    descent, which would calculate the average on the full dataset
    before updating the network
  - The trade off is that SGD only approximates the loss landscape for
    each batch, while full GD requires much more computation for each update
  - Also, you can argue that SGD should generalize better since its
    harder to fit to the datapoints and easier to fit general features 
    with the loss landscape constantly changing between updates
- =loss.backward()= performs the backpropagation on the computational
  graph, calculating the partial derivatives of the weights w.r.t. loss
  - Allows the graph to be built up in possibly several steps before
    computing, allowing for arbitrary flexibility
- An optimizer keeps track of the gradients and can potentially
  automatically set different learning rates for different parameters
  - E.g. look up Adam, Adagrad, or RMSprop for instance
  - We'll use the basic SGD optimizer here
- The =torch.optim= module contains several optimizers, which take in
  the network parameters and some options, and will keep track of the
  gradients, and apply a gradient descent (or similar) =step= to the
  network
  - We use =zero_grad= to zero out the gradients: you can also run
    several batches and then step the optimizer
- =n_epochs= is the number of times through the complete dataset you will train for
  - The more you train, the better the fit, but you need to be careful of overfitting

#+begin_src jupyter-python
# By default, pytorch operates on floats, not doubles
X, Y = th.tensor(variables.astype('float32')), th.tensor(species_enc)
# A basic stochastic gradient descent optimizer
n_epochs, minibatch_size = 5, 16
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.1)
loss_fn = th.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer.zero_grad()
for _ in range(n_epochs):
  for idx in range(0,len(X),minibatch_size):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    prediction = net(X[idx:idx+minibatch_size])
    loss = loss_fn(prediction, Y[idx:idx+minibatch_size])
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
print("Finished training!")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Finished training!

Now lets check the output of the trained network on some example
inputs.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
for x, y in zip(th.softmax(net(X[:5]),1), Y[:5]): print(x,y.item())
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([0.8616, 0.1243, 0.0142], grad_fn=<SelectBackward>) 0
: tensor([0.8222, 0.1574, 0.0203], grad_fn=<SelectBackward>) 0
: tensor([0.8498, 0.1341, 0.0161], grad_fn=<SelectBackward>) 0
: tensor([0.8101, 0.1647, 0.0252], grad_fn=<SelectBackward>) 0
: tensor([0.8670, 0.1192, 0.0138], grad_fn=<SelectBackward>) 0

Looking good. Lets check the accuracy of the network

#+begin_src jupyter-python
prediction=net(X)
_, prediction_y = th.max(prediction,1) # returns (the max value, position of the max value)
print(th.sum(prediction_y==Y) / float(len(Y))) # sum the number we got correct

#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor(0.6667)

67%, the network got stuck in a local minimum this time (you'll
probably get a different value).

Lets make a confusion matrix to find out where the network is having troubles

#+begin_src jupyter-python
confusion = th.zeros(3, 3)
for i, j in zip(net(X).max(1)[1], Y): confusion[i,j] += 1
plt.matshow(confusion)
plt.colorbar()
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
: <matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar at 0x7f87b4971670>
[[file:./.ob-jupyter/27134e8fc299bddc6138e225190f0a9253d53c0c.png]]
:END:

So its confusing 1 for 2. We could try training more, or if the
network is simply stuck in a local minima, try to retrain, possibly
changing some of the values.

Some exercises

- Try to increase the number of nodes in the hidden layer of the network, and retraining
- Try adding another hidden layer to the network and retraining
  - You'll need to add an =fc3= and you change the =fc2= output to
    more hidden nodes
- Try changing the optimizer. For example, try using =Adam=, does it
  help the network converge more quickly?
  - In this case though, there are very few datapoints...

* DNN: MNIST

- Okay, we're done with the warmup, lets try to build an actual deep
  learning network, by training an image classifier
- Another, more recent, classic classification task
- Given a 28x28 image of a handwritten digit, can you train a
  classifier to recognize the numbers from 0 to 9?
  - The data was collected by NIST, and Modified to fit into a
    standard format: 28x28 with 256 greyscale levels per pixel
- There is an additional library =torchvision= which has the ability
  to download the dataset into a torch dataset, which is a class that
  wraps up the X and Y tensors we were using
  - It gives us PIL images, we use the transform to change it to a
    tensor
  - There are other transformations you could perform on the image:
    cropping, normalizing, etc.
- The dataset is split into testing and training sets
  - The training set should be used to train the network, the testing
    set should only be used to test the network performance
  - This helps gauge how well the training is doing to generalize on
    unseen data

So, the data is a 60000x28x28 tensor, containing integer values from 0
to 255, and the output is a 60000 element tensor encoding the true
label in exactly the format needed for CrossEntropyLoss (and
corresponding to the real digit value). Lets view some images:

#+begin_src jupyter-python

  plt.subplot(2,4,i+1)
  plt.imshow(train_.data[i], cmap='gray')
print(train_.targets[:8])

We can use another facility of pytorch to create a =DataLoader=, which
wraps up our minibatching code from the previous section.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
train = th.utils.data.DataLoader(train_, batch_size=64)
test = th.utils.data.DataLoader(test_, batch_size=64)
#+end_src

** Convolutional Filter in PyTorch

Notice that x is actually given as a 4D tensor. The axis of length 1
is for image *channels*. If we had a color image, it would have length
3, after we pass it through a convolutional layer, it has # channels
== # filters in the layer.

Convolutional filters in pytorch are accessed with
=nn.Conv2d(nchannels_in, nchannels_out, filter_size)=.  Filter size
can be a scalar, in which case the filter is square, or you can pass a
2-tuple to specify the width and height.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
conv = nn.Conv2d(1, 5, 7)
conv(x).shape
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: torch.Size([64, 5, 22, 22])

No filter padding, so it has reduced the image size. The =padding=
optional argument can be used to pad the image.

** A Convolutional Network

Lets make a network. It consists of a few layers of convolutions of
varying sizes, then, we will turn the filter image into a 1d array,
and process it through a fully-connected hidden layer. We use relu
instead of sigmoid here. relu(x) = 0 for negative x and relu(x) = x
for postive x, it tends to be better for network, since it is harder
to saturate, and shut a node down.

#+begin_src jupyter-python
class ConvNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ConvNet, self).__init__()
        self.c1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 5, 7) # 28x28 -> 22x22
        self.c2 = nn.Conv2d(5, 10, 5) # 22x22 -> 18x18
        self.c3 = nn.Conv2d(10, 5, 3) # 18x18 -> 16x16
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16*16*5,100) # 5 channels of 16x16 images
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(100,10)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = th.relu(self.c1(x))
        x = th.relu(self.c2(x))
        x = th.relu(self.c3(x))
        # convert the 5x16x16 image into a 1d array with 5*16*16
        # elements, i.e. "flatten" it
        x = x.reshape(x.shape[0],-1)
        x = th.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

net = ConvNet()
net(x).shape
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** A More Complete Training Loop

- Since we have a testing sample this time, lets instrument our training loop a little
- We keep track of the running average of the loss / datapoint, and
  after 300 minibatches we print out the running average loss, as well
  as the average loss over the testing dataset
- We can check for overtraining (the test set will start to diverge
  from the training set)
  - Here, its a bit bumpy to tell, but you can see the training loss
    gets lower than the testing, indicating a possible saturation
    point for this model
- We also only put the data on the GPU as needed
  - GPU memory is a limited resource, we need to keep the network
    parameters and the data, so can't put the whole dataset on the GPU
    this time (unless google gives you an A100 or something...)

The model starts with a loss of -2.3, and saturates at about 0.05,
this means that the model is, on average, giving the correct item a
probability of 0.10 (10 categories, so this is equivalent to
completely random) at the beginning, and giving the correct item an
output of 0.95 at the end of training.

Lets check the accuracy on the test set. In this case, we won't be
able to compute all the predictions in one pass (we would need to fit
the whole test set on the GPU!).

#+begin_src jupyter-python
correct, tot = 0, 0
for x, y in test:
    x, y = x.to(d), y.to(d)
    prediction = net(x)
    _, prediction_y = th.max(prediction,1) # returns (the max value, position of the max value)
    correct += th.sum(prediction_y==y)
    tot += len(y)
print(f"Acc.: {correct/float(tot):.3f}")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: Acc.: 0.983

Exercises:
- Compare the speed of the network on and off the GPU
  - Convolutional layers are the reason we need beefy GPUs for deep learning!
- Try adding more layers to the network, whats the best accuracy you can get?
- With too deep a network you'll find it hard to stop from
  overtraining, try adding some regularization layers, such as
  dropout, illustrated below, or =nn.BatchNorm2d=
  - Dropout helps by only allowing part of the network to see the
    datapoint each training, so effectively you're training an
    ensemble of networks
  - BatchNorm smooths out the distribution of the values passed
    between layers as all the nodes update their weights, its
    generally always used these days (or something similar) due to how
    much it speeds up training large networks
  - With these layers you need to put the network into training or
    evaluation mode. Use =net.train()=, and =net.eval()= respectively

#+begin_src jupyter-python
drop = nn.Dropout(0.5)
print(th.ones(5))
print(drop(th.ones(5)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: tensor([1., 1., 1., 1., 1.])
: tensor([0., 2., 0., 2., 2.])

Note that the dropout compensates for the nodes it sets to zero by
increasing the value of the remaining non-zero nodes, so the
downstream node will see values of the same order of magnitude with or
without the dropout.

* GAN

The discriminator network can just be our network from before, with a
single output: is the image real or fake?

train = th.utils.data.DataLoader(train_, batch_size=32)
#+end_src

        super(Discr, self).__init__()
        self.c1 = nn.Conv2d(1, 16, 7) # 28x28 -> 22x22
        self.c2 = nn.Conv2d(16, 64, 5) # 22x22 -> 18x18
        self.c3 = nn.Conv2d(64, 8, 3) # 18x18 -> 16x16
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16*16*8,100) # 8 channels of 16x16 images
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(100,1)
        self.drop = nn.Dropout(0.5)
    def forward(self, x):

        # convert the 5x16x16 image into a 1d array with 5*16*16
        # elements, i.e. "flatten" it
        x = x.reshape(x.shape[0],-1)
        x = th.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = th.sigmoid(self.fc2(x))
        return x

dis = Discr().cuda()
print(dis(th.randn(1,1,28,28).cuda()).shape)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: torch.Size([1, 1])

** Generator

Here is the more interesting part. We want to take random noise, and
then output an image. We need to basically do the inverse of
convolving, that is, we take a image and pass it to the next layer
*adding* features based on the input, rather than searching for
them. We can use a =ConvTranspose2d= layer to do this

#+begin_src jupyter-python
class Gen(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size=100):
    super(Gen, self).__init__()
    self.input_size = input_size
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(self.input_size, 16*16*8)
    self.cc1 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(8,64,3) # 64x18x18
    self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)
    self.cc2 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(64,16,5) # 16x22x22
    self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(16)
    self.cc3 = nn.ConvTranspose2d(16,1,7) # 1x28x28
  def forward(self, x):
    x = th.relu(self.fc1(x))
    x = x.view(-1,8,16,16)
    x = th.relu(self.bn1(self.cc1(x)))
    x = th.relu(self.bn2(self.cc2(x)))
    x = th.sigmoid(self.cc3(x))
    return x

gen = Gen().cuda()
dis(gen(th.randn(10,100).cuda())).shape
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: torch.Size([10, 1])

** Training Loop

Notice we put dropout in the discriminator (its better to have a
smaller capacity discriminator, since it tends to be easier to train
the discriminator than the generator), and BatchNorm in the
generator. We want to speed up the generator training and control the
discriminator training. GANs are delicate!

We need to train both the discriminator and the generator. We set up
separate optimizers for each.

Our training loop starts by outputting sample images the generator is
currently creating. We use the same latent vectors each time, so we
can see the evolution of the same vector.

In the loop, we update the discriminator by converging the output
toward 1 for real images, and toward 0 for generated images.

We then update the generator, by passing the generated images through
the discriminator, and trying to send the value of the discriminator
toward 1 (by changing the *generator* weights, the discriminator
weights are fixed during this update).

We keep track of the average loss for the discriminator and generator
updates separately and record them at the end of each epoch. This is
particularly important here as GANs are prone to collapse: one of the
generator or discriminator becomes too good, and the other no longer
trains. This is usually seen by one of the losses going to 0, and the
other diverging. A good training run should have the generator and
discriminator fighting with each other, and small fluctuations in each
loss.  Another thing to look out for is *mode collapse*: this is where
the generator only outputs a single image, effectively ignoring the
random noise input. If all the images being produced in our test step
are the same, we probably have mode collapse.

Exercises:
- In this case, using batchnorm on the generator will greatly
  regularize and speed up the training.  What happens if you remove
  the normalization? [when I tried, I saw mode collapse]
- Try adding more or fewer layers, how does it affect the speed and
  quality of generation?

- The idea is to train two adverserial networks,
  - One is trying to create images equivalent to the MNIST dataset
    - Given an input of noise, the /latent space/
  - The other trying to label the images as either from the dataset or
    fake
    - Fake = generated by the opposing dataset

** Idea: Image generator network

- We start with the image generation network
- Essentially a image classifier in reverse. 
- The top layer is for high-level feature inputs which we'll randomly set during the trainingen. 
- We then pass through Dense layers and then reshape into a /7 x 7 x
  channels/ image-style layer.
- We =Upsampling2D= and pass through convolutional filters until the
  last layer which outputs a /28x28x1/ image as expected of an MNIST
  greyscale image.
  - Essentially we're /adding/ features as we go up, instead of
    /extracting/ features as we go down
- =BatchNormalization= is a technique to improve the network stability
  by providing the next layer inputs with zero mean and unit variance

** Discriminator

- Next, we create the discriminating network, with an image input
- As for classification, we have a convolutional layer attached to Dense layers. 
- For the output, we now have a single sigmoid with interpretation:
  - 0: The network thinks its definitely a generated image
  - 1: The network thinks its definitely a real MNIST dataset image

** GAN

- Now we set up a network which will be used to train the generation
  network. 
- Keras allows us to simply add the models we just created
  together into a Sequential like they were ordinary layers. 
- So, we feed the generator output into the discriminator input and
  set up an optimizer which will try to drive the generator to produce
  MNIST-like images (i.e. to fool the discriminator). 
- Keras allows us to turn layer training on and off through the
  "trainable" variable attached to a layer, so when we train the
  generator we can easily turn training for the discriminator off.

** Setup GAN

- Using Keras, we can simply add the generator and discriminator
  sub-networks into a new, combined network, similarly to any other
  layer!
- We can also simply tell it to turn off training the discriminator
  weights when we are optimizing the generator!

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session mltute :exports code

gen_discr.add(generate)
discr.trainable = False
gen_discr.add(discr)

                  metrics=['accuracy'])
discr.trainable = True
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Training the GAN

- Finally, we have the actual training
- Here, we setup the batches ourselves and alternate between training
  the discriminator and generator
  - =model.train_on_batch=
  - This was previously put together by Keras itself
- We start by taking a batch of MNIST images (labeled 1), and
  generator images (labeled 0) and run a training batch on the
  discriminator network
- Then, we turn off training off the discriminator and run training on
  the generator+discriminator network with random high-level feature
  inputs to the generator
- We try to drive all the outputs to 1, i.e. train the generator to
  more MNIST-like images (as according to the discriminator network)
- Last remark: we are saving the networks after each epoch with
  =model.save=
  - Load with =keras.models.load_model=

** Extensions

- Try different networks, what works well, what fails badly?
- Add another set of inputs hot-one encoding the number you want to
  generate,
  - The discriminator will need to say which number it believes its
    seeing as well as how likely it is to be real
  - The generator will need to train with the number output as a loss
    also
- Some further ideas on the next pages, work in progress code :-)

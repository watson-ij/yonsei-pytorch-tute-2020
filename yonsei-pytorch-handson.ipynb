Use when\nthere's only 2 classes to classify.

In pytorch, the\nloss function applies the softmax itself (so we don't need it in our\nnetwork), and then applies the -log(p) function on the true values\noutput [think of it like the -log of the networks probability for it\nto be the true value].\n\n    loss_fn = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()\n    # the net is on the GPU, here we create 3 inputs, each filled with zeros\n    out = net(torch.zeros(3,4).cuda())\n     # for CrossEntropyLoss, the true values should be the position of the real label\n    print(loss_fn(out, torch.tensor([0,1,2]).cuda()))\n    # Note that the output is the *average* of the losses of all the input items\n    #   this makes it easier to process a batch of inputs and run gradient descent\n\nJust to be explicit of what CrossEntropyLoss means.\n\n-   *softmax* normalizes the output layer so it sums to 1: $f_k(x) = \\frac{e^{-y_k}}{\\sum_i e^{-y_i}}$\n-   Cross-entropy loss is the -log(p) where p is the output of the softmax for the (known) true value\n    -   We are in the fully-labelled paradigm for training\n\n    out = net(torch.zeros(1,4).cuda())\n    loss = loss_fn(out, torch.tensor([0]).cuda())\n    # use item() to extract a single value from a tensor and return as a python float\n    print(\"output of the loss_fn\", loss.item())\n    # we softmax over the outputs (zeroth axis is the datapoints axis, first axis is the output axis)\n    print(torch.softmax(out,1))\n    # The softmax output sums to 1, hence its like a \"probability for each possible output\"\n    print(torch.softmax(out,1).sum().item())\n    # then cross entropy is the -log(p) where p is the true output, here\n    # we pretend that we know the 0th category is the true category\n    print(-torch.log(torch.softmax(out,1)[0,0]).item())\n\nThe closer the output of the true value is to 1, the closer the\nCrossEntropyLoss is to 0. The closer it is to 0, the CrossEntropyLoss\nwill exponentially approach -infinity. Hence, minimizing the\nCrossEntropyLoss is equivalent to maximizing the softmax output\nprobability of the true value to 1, and true value softmax outputs\nclose to 0 are exponentially penalized (its worse to be close to 0\nthan it is to be a little bit further from 1).\n\nIf you want to apply the softmax inside the network yourself, you can\nuse `NLLLoss` instead of `CrossEntropyLoss`. The reason you wouldn't\nis that to get a \"prediction\" from an unknown datapoint after training\nthe network, you can just take the position with the max of the\nnetwork output, you don't need to calculate the (relatively expensive)\nsoftmax, which is just rescaling the values so they're all between 0\nand 1.\n\n`BCELoss` expects a value between 0 and 1, so you should apply\n`sigmoid` to the final layer in this case.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Calculating Gradients\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["One final thing that we need to do is to calculate the partial\nderivatives of all the parameters of the model with respect to the\nloss, then we can use the gradient descent algorithm to update the\nweights.
